>
Research software engineer in the NSF-funded
[Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System](https://csdms.colorado.edu) (CSDMS).
Core developer of CSDMS' open-source model coupling cyberinfrastructure that
transforms models written in Fortran, C, and C++ into plug-and-play Python
components through a standards-based, jinja-templated, Cython workflow.

>
Core developer of the Basic Model Interface (BMI) standard.

>
Presented work through conferences, journal articles, webinars, and workshops.

>
Research interests include model benchmarking and uncertainty quantification.

>
Co-PI on grants funded by NSF, NASA, and USGS.

>
Lead instructor of the Earth Surface Processes Institute (ESPIn) summer school.

>
Co-author of 10 journal articles and 18 software products.

>

for the scientific data analysis and visualization language IDL.
In concert with the lead developer,
tasked with guiding the direction of the language,
including prioritizing enahancements and maintenance.

>
Performed market research and competitive analyses
(primarily versus Python and MATLAB);
gathered user feedback though onsite customer visits
(particularly at NASA, NOAA, and U.S. National Labs)
and attendance at scientific conferences;
participated in the design of the IDL and ENVI
(geospatial image analysis application) APIs;
wrote user stories, developed requirements, managed the product backlog.

*Solutions Engineer* (2010-2012)

>
Product owner and technology evangelist for IDL.
Worked with the IDL product manager and lead developer
to prioritize development for future releases.
Engaged in user outreach by developing and presenting
quarterly live seminars and webinars
on topics ranging from numerical analysis techniques
to file formats to visualization.
Provided external support to users through
presentations at scientific conferences,
blogging, and custom programming solutions.
Provided internal technical product assistance
for Sales, Marketing, Tech Support, Services, and Product Management.

*Professional Services Engineer* (1999-2010)

>
Designed, developed and taught over 180
introductory through advanced-level programming courses in IDL and ENVI
to over 1500 students, with excellent reviews.
Primary customers included NASA, NOAA, Los Alamos National Lab,
Lawrence Livermore National Lab, Sandia National Lab, JPL, Raytheon, and USGS.
Created domain-specific courses on signal processing,
medical image processing, and scientific programming with IDL.
Developed customer solutions using
IDL, ENVI, Fortran, C, and Java.
Responsible for project estimation, design, development, testing,
and documentation.
