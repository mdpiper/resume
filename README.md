# resume

My resume.
It's written in Markdown,
and rendered to Word and PDF with pandoc.

An encrypted cover letter is included
(I have to keep some secrets);
don't forget to decrypt it before building.

Build:

    make


Display (macOS only, using custom PDF viewer):

    make show

Clean:

    make clean

Note that there are different versions (one page, multipage, LaTeX) of the resume
in separate branches in this repository.
