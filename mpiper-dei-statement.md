# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement -- Mark Piper

I am a white male in the United States.

Because I'm a white male,  
I wasn't told math is too hard.  
Because I'm a white male,  
I didn't get shot by a police officer for underage drinking.  
Because I'm a white male,  
I had the opportunity to attend good schools.

The privilege I have as a white male is self-reinforcing.  
It has built on itself as my career progressed:  
I have a fulfilling job in academia because  
I was able to get job interviews because  
I have a good professional network because  
I went to good schools because  
I had good grades because  
the system is set up for me, a white male, to succeed.

I recognize my privilege and what I've gained from it.  
I will not pull up the ladder behind me.
